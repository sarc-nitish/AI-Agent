# AI Agent 

## Project Title:
AI Agent Development using LlamaIndex and Groq

## Overview:
This project demonstrates the creation of an AI agent using LlamaIndex and Groq's language model to perform arithmetic operations through natural language queries. The agent leverages the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework to reason about user inputs and execute appropriate tools, showcasing a practical application of AI agent development.

## Objectives:
- Develop an AI agent capable of processing natural language arithmetic queries.
- Enable the agent to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using custom tools.
- Utilize LlamaIndex's ReAct framework to structure reasoning and tool execution effectively.

## Technologies & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LlamaIndex (`llama-index`)
- llama-index-llms-groq
- os (for environment variable management)

## Step-by-Step Workflow:

### 1. Install Dependencies
The notebook begins by installing the required libraries:
```bash
!pip install llama-index llama-index-llms-groq
```
- **Purpose**: Installs `llama-index` for agent development and `llama-index-llms-groq` for integration with Groq's language model.

### 2. Import Necessary Modules
Key modules for agent creation and tool definition are imported:
```python
import os
from llama_index.core.agent import ReActAgent
from llama_index.llms.groq import Groq
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
```
- **Purpose**: Sets up the environment for building the ReAct agent and defining tools.

### 3. Set Groq API Key
The Groq API key is securely set using:
```python
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "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"
```
- **Purpose**: Authenticates access to Groq's language model.

### 4. Initialize Groq Language Model
The Groq language model is configured:
```python
llm = Groq(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    temperature=0
)
```
- **Purpose**: Creates a deterministic language model instance for the agent's reasoning.

### 5. Define Arithmetic Tools
Four arithmetic functions are defined and converted into tools:
```python
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Add two numbers and return the sum."""
    return a + b

def subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Subtract the second number from the first number and return the result"""
    return a - b

def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiply twi numbers abd return teh product"""
    return a * b

def devide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide the first number by the second number and return teh quotient"""
    return a / b

add_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=add)
subtract_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=subtract)
multiply_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=multiply)
devide_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=devide)

tools_list = [add_tool, subtract_tool, multiply_tool, devide_tool]
```
- **Purpose**: Provides the agent with tools to perform arithmetic operations. Note: The `devide` function has typos ("devide" instead of "divide", "teh" instead of "the").

### 6. Create ReAct Agent
The ReAct agent is initialized with the language model and tools:
```python
agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(
    tools_list,
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)
```
- **Purpose**: Combines the Groq LLM and arithmetic tools to create an agent capable of reasoning and acting.

### 7. Test the Agent with Queries
The agent is tested with arithmetic queries:
```python
response = agent.chat("What is 20 divided by 2")
response = agent.chat("What is 20 plus 2")
response = agent.chat("What is 20+(2*4)? Use tool to calculate evry step.")
```
- **Purpose**: Validates the agent's ability to process natural language queries and execute tools correctly.

## Sample Outputs:
Below are the outputs from the notebook, showcasing the agent's responses:

1. **Query: "What is 20 divided by 2"**
   - **Agent's Reasoning**:
